# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to provide an interactive way to understand sorting algorithms. It visually represents different sorting techniques, allowing users to observe how elements are compared, swapped, and sorted step by step.

## 🔥 Features
- **Supports Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Each algorithm is managed through separate JS files, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can adjust the array size and sorting speed.
- **Color-Coded Visualization**: Highlights different stages of sorting for better understanding.
- **Custom Favicon**: Includes a favicon to enhance the website's appearance.

| Currently Comparing  | `.focus-Bar`   | 🔵 **Cyan (#00FFFF)**       
| Incorrect Position   | `.error-Bar`   | 🔴 **Crimson (#DC143C)**     
| Being Modified       | `.modify-Bar`  | 🟠 **Amber (#FFB300)**
